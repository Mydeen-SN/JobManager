#### What is Job Manager?

Job Manager is designed to help organizations efficiently track the pending tasks ordered based on the priorities set by both the assignee and the assigner team and this will be visible for all the team, so this will help the assigner to track the execution order of their tasks and the task assigned to them by other teams. Once we create an issue it will list out the overall issues based on the issue type and their priority assigned by reporter. It will sort the issues priority by comparing Both assignee and reporter’s priority of issue.

This application will have APIs to connect with JIRA, GitLab, etc to group and view the tasks across all the tools.
